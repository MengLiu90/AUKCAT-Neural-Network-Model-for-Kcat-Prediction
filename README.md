# AUKCAT-Neural-Network-Model-for-Kcat-Prediction
This neural network is designed to predict enzyme turnover numbers (kcat) from triplet features: substrate, EC number, and species, using both the original experimental dataset and high-confidence pseudo-labeled data selected via the AUKCAT-Data-Selection-Pipeline.
